## Models

Change your models (in models.py).
Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.

# returns their SQL
$ python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001

# If you’re interested, you can also run python manage.py check; this checks for any problems in your project without making migrations or touching the database.
$ python manage.py check


## Generic Views
Let’s convert our poll app to use the generic views system, so we can delete a bunch of our own code. We’ll just have to take a few steps to make the conversion. We will:

1. Convert the URLconf.
2. Delete some of the old, unneeded views.
3. Introduce new views based on Django’s generic views.

## Tutorial, Part 6 - Static files management
That’s what django.contrib.staticfiles is for: it collects static files from each of your applications (and any other places you specify) into a single location that can easily be served in production.
